# sentinel-docker
Example Docker Compose Sentinel Redis Implementation

This is a sample implementation of 3 sentinels and 3 redis instances in docker.

The purpose of this repo is to learn and setup an easy cluster for troubleshooting.

It uses the vanilla `alpine-redis` as a base and then builds the sentinel containers.
